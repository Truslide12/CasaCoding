						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>
							With 20 years of hardware, softwar, test engineering experience, I bring a highly energeing, positive and can do attitude to any team. My projects and programs focus on an adaptive and innovative approach that focuses on product integrity and a complete and intuitive user experience. Six Sigma principals are used in all projects to ensure that each project and product are optimized. This minimizes back end issues, streamlines performance and quality in manufacturing, testing and end product desing.
						</P>
						<p>I look forward to sharing my energy and passion for design with your team.</p>
