						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>
							With 20 years of hardware, softwar, test engineering experience, I bring a highly
							energeing, positive and can do attitude to any team. My projects and programs focus on
							an adaptive and innovative approach that focuses on product integrity and a complete and
							intuitive user experience. Six Sigma principals are used in all projects to ensure that
							each project and product are optimized. This minimizes back end issues, streamlines
							performance and quality in manufacturing, testing and end product desing.
						</P>
						<p>I look forward to sharing my energy and passion for design with your team.</p>

							included failure analysis, sustainability testing and component engineering for the VELA,
							VMAX, SiPAP, Cub750, Blender and Airlife Driver medical device product lines as well as
							managing the PCBA Repair lab team. I managed Green and Black Belt level Projects varying in
							scope from component replacements, to complete system redesigns and testing process
							optimization. My projects gave the company a competitive advantage during the swine flu
							crises and allowed our Sipap devices to remain competitive against newer products from
							companies as well as streamlining and saving money through process improvements on all

							required determining the best sensors for the equipment and any fluids/chemicals, wear and
							tear, etc. that the sensors might come into contact with and working with an extensive
							variety of Programmable Logic Controllers to ensure proper data feedback/recording and
							relay/warning actuation, lastly working with different teams to get wiring and equipment
